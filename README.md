# Social Network API 

  ## Description
  This application provides the backend APIs for a social network application. It is built using node.js, express, mongoDB and Mongoose for an ODM. A user can use our APIs to create Users, which can have friends, who are other users. Each user can create thoughts and users can add reactions to other user's thoughts. These users, thoughts, friends and reactions can be updated and removed.
